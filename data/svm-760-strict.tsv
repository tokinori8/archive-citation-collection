I refer to the appendix. The central question of this chapter is whether we can discern any patterns of surgical recruitment on the vessels of the Company in the eighteenth century, with the understanding that for the non-Dutch ship's surgeons no baptismal registers have been checked and that their statements of place of origin have been taken here at face value. The emphasis of non-Dutch ship's surgeons will be on Germany. However, no specific research has been done on the economic and demographic history of the German states. What is presented in this chapter in connection with the non-Dutch ship's surgeons are 'merely' the results of the queries for Sample S, and any conclusions about these surgeons' geographical origins should be interpreted with caution. This table excludes the surgeons of unknown origin. The numbers on which this table is based are presented in Appendix 1. The method of the sample is explained in appendix 1.

Charles Ghislain Wilmet wrote several letters about his voyages as ship's surgeon to his family in Belgium. His letters were brought back to the Republic to be posted there by returning 'friends'. Born in the village Gembloux near Namur on 28 October, 1757, Wilmet travelled to Rotterdam at the beginning of 1779 to lodge with a 'friend' Master-Surgeon Van Putten who had his shop and home in the Breestraat. Wilmet wrote to his aunt and uncle on 11 March 1779 that he had been to the Chamber of Rotterdam to present his letters and certificates. The authorities were quite interested in him as a prospective employee and they told him that he would be tested on his surgical knowledge in order to determine his rank (first surgeon, first surgeon's mate or third surgeon). Passing his exam with honours, he subsequently sailed (probably) on the Willem Frederik (a vessel with a crew of more than 300 men) as first a ship's surgeon. In 1782, he was employed by the merchant fleet; in 1784, on the whaling fleet and at the Admirality of Rotterdam, and in 1785 and in 1790 again, by the Company's. Clearly, he must have, at least, enjoyed his work as a ship's surgeon. Though Wilmet did not write much about his work, he does describe small parcels to be delivered to friends. Charles Ghislain Wilmet continued working as a first ship's surgeon until his demise in Asia in 1791."		ea4c843fe045e40e11e3f9ef53da2177be6d5e3a	https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A2723076/view

Under Aasdom Law 'the nearest blood inherits the goods'. Succession, under Aasdom Law, first moved directly down the family tree, then directly up, only finally moving across to collaterals. So, for example, if a woman died without having any children or any surviving parents, her property would devolve completely to her surviving parent, or, next in line, any surviving grandparent(s); lastly her brothers and sisters would be benefactors. In the case of inter-state succession under the Aasdom Law (absent children and one parent), property followed the lineal kin of the deceased first, then the collateral kin. Schependom Law operated under the maxim that het goed moet gaan van daer het gekomen is, or 'the goods must go from whence they came'. The guiding assumption made by Schependom Law is that upon the death of a parent, half of the family estate would pass to the surviving offspring. Upon the death of the son or daughter of the deceased parent, that son or daughter's estate would go to the other remaining offspring of the deceased parent and not to the surviving parent. Since, in theory, the legacy did not come from the surviving parent, they 'must go from whence they came', first to the children of the deceased, then to deceased's side of the family. It has also been observed of Schependom Law that 'the goods do not like to climb', pointing to the fact that collaterals or brothers and sisters inherited before grandparents.

The Story of Housing, a sweeping overview of housing conditions and policies from colo- nial times to the 1970s published in 1979 by the Fannie Mae Foundation, includes seven pages that were actually plagiarized from Harriss. See G. S. Fish, ed., The Story of Housing (New York: Macmillan/Fannie May Foundation, 1979). The numerous texts dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal have consistently included only a few sentences or paragraphs about HOLC. Arthur Schlesinger provided one of the most positive assessments of HOLC's impact, crediting HOLC with ""restoring the morale of a vital section of the middle class"" as it ""averted the threatened collapse of the real estate market and enabled financial institutions to begin to return to the mortgage-lending business.""

For fifty-eight of the loans, the mortgage instrument recorded the address as the distance from the closest intersection rather than with a house number (which is the basis for census records). For another fifty-five records that did include house numbers, that address could not be found in the census records. Finally, for the remaining twenty-five records, the name of the owner differed between the mortgage and census records. The property probably changed ownership for most of these addresses between the time the census data were collected in 1930 and HOLC made the loan between 1933 and 1936. 21.
